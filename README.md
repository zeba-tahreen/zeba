## Zeba Portfolio

Welcome to my profile and this is my portfolio, if you familiar with my repositories then you must have seen this portfolio in another repo as [Portfolio](https://zeba-tahreen.github.io/)
, but there is alot of diffrenece between the language used to create both the apps. 

This repo is a moderate version of my portfolio, earlier I have build the app using html, css and javascript. Hence as a developer we need to run with the new technologies and keep ourself up to the market I have re-created the same web with using React as javascript framework and Materialize for styling the web application. 

## Tools and technologies used

* React
* React-Materialize


## Project Live
