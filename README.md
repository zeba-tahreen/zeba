## Zeba Portfolio

Welcome to my profile and this is my portfolio, if you familiar with my repositories then you must have seen this portfolio in another repo as [zeba-tahreen.github.io](https://zeba-tahreen.github.io/), but there is alot of diffrenece between the languages used to create both the apps. 

This repo is a moderate version of my portfolio, earlier I have build this same app using HTML, Css and JavaScript. Hence as a developer we need to run with the new technologies and keep ourself up to the market. So here, I have re-created the same web app with using React (JavaScript framework) and Materialize for styling the web application. 

## Tools and Technologies used

* React
* Bootstrap
* React-Bootstrap
* React-Spring
* GoogleFronts
  

## Project Live

Coming soon
